# ExcelPortfolio
This is my Excel Portfolio.

MyAnimeList is based on the data collected in my personal MyAnimeList. I only included completed anime, and this will be updated when needed. Since the website only give overall count data and mean averages, I created this dashboard project to visualize information particularly about the animation studios, genres, and how scores affect this data. The visualized data includes bar charts, pie charts, and a line graph. Some information I can analyze include: what animation studios create content I enjoy, patterns in watch history and scores, and the bias I have in content.

Other information about the data from MyAnimeList is that titles are separated by seasons such as in the website due to long running shows having breaks, studio transfers, or quality changes. I only included a secondary genre and not all data for better readability, in case of I would like to import it into a different program, and since majority of shows had two genres and only a minority did not have a second genre. Also, if referring to the data, do not display all studios since the data will be cluttered and decrease readability.

Bike Project demonstrates data cleaning, Pivot Tables, and dashboard creation for a data set of over a thousand rows. This data set is from Alex The Analyst on YouTube. The deliverables created in this project are seen in the MyAnimeList project but with a larger set of data.
