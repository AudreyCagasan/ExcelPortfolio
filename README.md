This is my Excel Portfolio.

Bike Project demonstrates data cleaning, Pivot Tables, and dashboard creation for a data set of over a thousand rows. This data set is from Alex The Analyst on YouTube.

MyAnimeList is based on the data collected in my personal MyAnimeList. I only included completed anime, and this will be updated when needed. I created this project to visualize information about particularly the animation studios, genres, and scores since the website only count data and give mean averages.
